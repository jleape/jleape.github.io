Following the success of the East River Ferry, the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) hired Steer Group to identify new viable routes connecting the buroughs. I customized a spreadsheet model that incorporated Journey To Work (JTW) data, development data from the City, Level-Of-Service (LOS) data from the MTA and partner consultants, and a choice model from a recent survey. The model estimates ridership and revenue for service connecting any permutation of 35 sites among all 5 boroughs.

In 2015, Mayor DeBlasio announced his support for a citywide ferry system and has since scheduled 5 routes, chosen based on our analysis, to begin operating in 2017.
