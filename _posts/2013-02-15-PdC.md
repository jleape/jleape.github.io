[C40 Cities](https://www.c40.org/), in partnership with the [Clinton Climate Initiative](https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-climate-initiative) and [U.S. Green Building Council](https://www.usgbc.org/), launched the [Climate Positive Development Program](https://www.c40.org/other/climate-positive-development-program#:~:text=The%20Climate%20Positive%20Development%20Program,most%20ambitious%20low%2Dcarbon%20projects) to recognize the most ambitious low-carbon urban development projects in the world. *Odebrecht Realizações* endeavored to be the first developer to achieve Climate Positive certification in Latin America with *Parque da Cidade*, a mixed-use development for 65,000 daily users in São Paulo. To eliminate transportation-related emissions, Odebrecht hired *LOGIT Engenharia* to model baseline carbon emissions and identify cost-effective reduction and offset strategies. 

Drawing on São Paulo's recent origin-destination survey, I estimated the mode split and commute distances of all 65,000 users to calculate a baselin carbon emissions inventory. Researching broadly, I identified 24 design interventions that could promote low-carbon modes. I developed a spreadsheet tool to model emissions for scenarios, accounting for cases when strategies worked synergistically or competitively. The most attractive solutions, in terms of visibility and effectiveness, were on-site bicycle infrastructure, electric car charging stations and commuter shuttle drop-off zones. I estimated that the final mobility plan would reduce emissions by 60%.

According to Climate Positive Development Program rules, the remaining 40% of emissions would have to be offset locally. Fortunately, there were two high-profile offset opportunities nearby that would directly benefit the users of the development. I proposed that *Odebrecht* build a pedestrian bridge connecting *Parque da Cidade* to the nearest train station to the North and fund the extension of an exclusive-lan bus corridor along the southern edge of the site. The projects would more than offset the remaining 40% of emissions, and thus count toward offsetting other emissions from the construction and use of the development.
