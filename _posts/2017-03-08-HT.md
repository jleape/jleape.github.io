As a mobility advisor in the Mayor's Office of Bogot√°, Colombia, I co-led a study to prioritize infrastructure investments in the city's renowned Bus Rapid Transit system, Transmilenio. Drawing on queing theory, I developed a framework to identify interventions based on interactions between various types of congestion. 

Recognizing that both demand and supply are constantly in flux for most transit systems, I created HyperionTransit, an app to automatically calculate congestion indicators and plan new routes and infrastructure using [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs), demand matrices and Emme model outputs.

## Features
An interactive Leaflet map visualizes how congestion evolves over the day by station, corridor, route, segment and origin-destination pair.

Dynamic charts on the left panel graph congestion over time at various locations and scales.

Users can select a sequence of zones to reveal station pairs with highest demand, indicating where to locate stops on express routes.
