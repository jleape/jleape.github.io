title: Exploring Collinear Bus Routes in Atlanta as Artifacts of Segregation

Regions with uncoordinated transit agencies often have multiple bus routes running parallel, creating a confusing user experience and costly competition. We hypothesized that such cases might persist if the collinear bus routes serve demographically distinct populations. I developed an algorithm (Python + PostGIS) to automatically identify collinear bus routes from standardized transit data (GTFS), statistically compare the demographic character of the populations served by the stops of each route, and visualize the results in an interactive web map (Leaflet).

Using Atlanta as a case study, we found several examples that support our hypothesis.
