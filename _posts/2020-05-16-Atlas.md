Through a partnership between Sarah Williams and Lorena Bello Gomez of MIT and the Mexico City government, we developed an interactive web-based platform for residents of Mexico City to learn how to protect themselves from a range of risks. The Atlas features an interactive map that displays recent nearby incidents.

After discovering the most imminent risks, users can then explore a dynamic array of cards that summarize relevant protective measures.

While we demonstrated the platform with risks related to flooding, gas leaks and coronavirus, non-technical professionals can easily expand the platform to include other risks or preventive measures.
