After a year of research, design iteration and raising over $300,000 worth of donations, 24 [CUSD](https://jleape.github.io/CUSD/) students headed to South Africa to build an Early Childhood Development (ECD) Center. As Construction Manager, I led the students and over 100 local contractors on site in building the 6,000 SF facility over a 5-month period. 

Consisting of durable and locally sourced materials, the ECD Center features passive temperature regulation, rainwater collection and solar water heating. Managed by [Play with a Purpose](https://preschools4africa.org/) Educational Trust, the center serves as a pre-school for over 80 children and hosts training sessions for teachers of pre-schools throughout the region.
