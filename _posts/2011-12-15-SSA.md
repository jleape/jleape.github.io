As Construction Manager, I led 24 Cornell students and over 100 local contractors in building an early childhood development center near Johannesburg, South Africa. At over 6,000 SF, the center serves over 80 children and hosts training sessions for teachers of pre-schools throughout the region.

Consisting of durable and locally sourced materials, the buildings feature passive temperature regulation, rainwater collection and solar water heating.
