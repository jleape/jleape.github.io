I participated in a competition to design an eco-city in Northern China that would serve as a model for future urban development in the region. Integrating scientific research from Les Ateliers with site research on Chinese urban forms, my team prototyped an urban morphology that adapted the traditional courtyard structure of imperial cities to meet modern demands for mobility and efficiency. 

To demonstrate our concept, we built a 3D model of our proposed city and produced a graphic booklet outlining a phased construction plan. Our city featured a car-free zone, BRT system, integrated grey-water recycling, and bioremediation system.

Following the workshop, the Chinese National Government hired the Cornell team to develop guidelines for zoning, streetscape design, building codes, and transit.
