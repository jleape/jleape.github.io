In 2010, [Cornell University Solar Decathlon](https://cusd.cornell.edu/projects/sd/) merged with [DEED](https://jleape.github.io/DEED) to form [Cornell University Sustainable Design](https://cusd.cornell.edu/). The student-run group has completed 10 projects, all of which bring cutting-edge sustainable design to make lasting social impact in challenging contexts.

In preparation for [SSA](https://jleape.github.io/SSA), we prepared a reference book for architecture students competing to design an Early Childhood Development (EDC) Center near Johannesburg, South Africa. I prepared materials on South Africa's political and architectural history.

As leader of engineering and construction research teams, I also developed an energy model of the winning design, which helped us strategically locate thermal mass and optimize shading in order to achieve a completely passive temperature regulation.
