After managing construction in South Africa and advising infrastructure projects in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and the U.S., I pursued a dual master's degree from MIT to broaden my domain and elevate my skills. I took deep dives in resilience, disaster recovery, urban economics, spatial analytics, machine learning and causal inference, and recently graduated eager to work with motivated teams to solve complex social and environmental problems.
